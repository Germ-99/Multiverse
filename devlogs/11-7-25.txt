It's pretty early again and I just pushed some new changes

Added "ephemeral" parameter to /mmr-view command (See commit: 8eec23d)
Make every message sent in #command-central get automatically removed by the bot (See commit: 8eec23d)

That's all I have for today, I'm gonna add echo queueing soon because sprockee is generating me a server key to have access to
the nakama API, just so I can make the bot pull servers.

My god am I happy it's friday, can finally chill out for another 2 days and slack off

On a side note, my Rift CV1 *should* arrive monday according to USPS. However, I hope it is a lot sooner than that.

Anyways, that's about it, see ya
